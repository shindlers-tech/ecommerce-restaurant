The project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) restaurant application with various features. Here is a description of the project

The application allows the admin to add products to the restaurant menu. Users can then view and filter the available products. To access the application, users need to authenticate by loging in or signing up. During the sign-up process, users can upload a profile picture.

Once logged in, users can add items to their cart. The cart allows users to increase or decrease the quantity of items. Only authenticated users are allowed to proceed with the purchase of items.

For payment processing, the Stripe payment method is implemented in the application. This enables secure and convenient online transactions.

To enhance user experience, the application includes error handling with a 404 page for handling missing pages or routes. The design of the application is responsive, ensuring compatibility across different devices and screen sizes. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the user interface.

State management in the application is implemented using Redux Toolkit, which provides a predictable state container for managing the application's data.

The application is deployed live on Vercel for the frontend hosting, while the backend is hosted on Render. This allows the application to be accessible to users on the internet.

The future scope of a MERN restaurant applications: 

1. Online Ordering: Implement a fully functional online ordering system where customers can browse the menu, customize their orders, and make payments online. This can include features like order tracking and delivery status updates.

2. Reservation System: Integrate a reservation system where customers can book tables in advance. This can include features like selecting preferred seating, specifying the number of guests, and receiving confirmation notifications.

3. Loyalty Program: Develop a loyalty program to reward regular customers. Implement features such as points accumulation, special discounts, and personalized offers to encourage customer loyalty and repeat business.

4. Social Media Integration: Allow customers to share their dining experiences on social media platforms directly from the application. Enable features like reviews, ratings, and recommendations to leverage user-generated content for marketing purposes.

5. Analytics and Reporting: Incorporate advanced analytics and reporting functionalities to gain insights into customer behavior, popular menu items, peak hours, and revenue trends. This can help in making data-driven decisions for business growth and optimization.

6. Mobile Application: Develop a mobile version of the application for enhanced accessibility and convenience. This can include features like push notifications, mobile payment integration, and location-based services.
